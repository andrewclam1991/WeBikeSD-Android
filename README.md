## WeBikeSD, 2018 ##
San Diego, CA. USA

Project contributor: [Andrew Lam](https://github.com/andrewclam1991)

### Summary

This is the dev fork to modernize and refactor the WeBikeSD app to have a modern and
maintainable architecture. Uses MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) + RxJava.

### Dependencies

* [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
* [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)
* [SqlBrite](https://github.com/square/sqlbrite)

## Features

### Complexity - understandability

#### Use of architectural frameworks/libraries/tools:

Building an app with RxJava is not trivial as it uses new concepts.

#### Conceptual complexity

Developers need to be familiar with RxJava, which is not trivial.

### Testability

#### Unit testing

Very High. Given that the RxJava ``Observable``s are highly unit testable, unit tests are easy to implement.

#### UI testing

TODO
